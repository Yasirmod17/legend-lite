"""A PROJECT'S OWN DATABASE on Python's DuckDB (docs/ONE_PLATFORM_PROGRAM_2026_10_12.md C5), the twin of the tab's
(engine-client/src/project-data.ts): where a project version's Data rows live when Query or Studio, served by Python,
runs one of its queries, or a saved query opens on Python's page -- a database of their own inside Python's DuckDB, its
schemas as the model declares them, never beside a person's frames. What it is, and every statement that makes, points
at and fills it, is the native library's (``compiler.project_data``, the platform's ProjectData in Java, by this
database's type), named by what it holds (the model's Databases and Data rows); Python spells none. Made the first time
a query over the model asks, on a cursor of its own, and kept for the process's life (the user, 2026-10-13: no strategy
for letting one go; legend-lite's server keeps its own so too). A model with no Data rows has none."""
