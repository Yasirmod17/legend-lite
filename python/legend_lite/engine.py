"""A small Legend engine over frames: legend-engine's ``pure/v1`` API, answered on this machine, so DataCube's
remote client (``engine-client/src/engine-remote.ts``) runs against a Python process exactly as it runs against
legend-engine. Design: ``docs/DATACUBE_PYTHON_SHOW_DESIGN_2026_10_08.md``.

    frames = Frames()
    frames.register('trades', df)
    engine = Engine(frames)              # the answers: engine.answer(method, path, query, body)
    server = WebServer(engine)           # to a browser tab: HTTP at server.url, in a background thread
    ...
    server.close()

The engine has no transport. A browser tab reaches it over HTTP (``WebServer``); a notebook's cube over the widget's
own channel (``legend_lite.notebook``). Both send it the same calls.

Every answer but execute's rows is legend-lite's own server code (``PureV1Api``, through the native library),
so this module holds no Legend protocol: it runs the SQL the compiler wrote, and carries HTTP. execute
answers in upstream's Arrow format (``?serializationFormat=ARROW_IPC``: a zstd-compressed Arrow IPC stream
whose schema metadata carries the builder, the SQL that ran and the columns), the one format this engine
declares; DuckDB produces Arrow, so JSON would be the extra conversion.

Over HTTP, only what the developer's own page sends is answered: the server listens on 127.0.0.1 alone, every call
for the engine's data carries its one-time token (``Authorization: Bearer <token>``), a request is refused unless its
Host names this machine (DNS rebinding), and no cross-origin header is ever sent. Only queries over the models the
frames' tables were written with are run, and only SQL the compiler wrote.
