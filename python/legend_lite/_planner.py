"""THE PLANNER PROTOCOL, answered by legend-lite's native library (datacube/src/planner-protocol.ts): each request kind
DataCube's planner sends, the native function answering it, and that function's arguments from the request. Each
function delegates to the Boundary function the tab's TabExports export of that kind delegates to, so the tab's worker
and Python answer every request the same way. ``KINDS`` is that table, the one place it is written: DataCube's
headless engine answers by it (legend_lite._headless), and so does Python's engine for a page
(docs/DATACUBE_ONE_APP_DESIGN_2026_10_11.md §15: planner.json, plan-and-run.json). Python's standard library only."""
