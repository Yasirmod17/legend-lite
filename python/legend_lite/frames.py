"""Dataframes as Legend tables: a frame registered in duckdb-python, its model written by the compiler, and
queries the compiler plans run by DuckDB, answered as Arrow.

    frames = Frames()
    trades = frames.register('trades', df)              # Live: every query reads df as it is then
    trades.execute("->filter(x|$x.desk == 'FX')")       # a pyarrow.Table, typed by the plan

A frame is anything Arrow reads: a pandas or polars DataFrame, a pyarrow Table, any object that exports
Arrow -- or a function returning one, so a Live table follows a frame you rebuild. It is handed to DuckDB
AS ARROW: duckdb-python's own pandas reader is about ten times slower on text columns, and reading a
pandas frame through it once does not see later changes (pandas copies on write).

LIVE (the default) re-reads the frame at every query, so the answer is the frame's as it is then; if its
columns changed, the model is written again. SNAPPED copies it into DuckDB once: faster to query, and it
never changes. Either way the frame is an ordinary DuckDB table or view named as registered, so the
compiler reads its catalog and writes its model exactly as it does for a DataCube table
(``table_model``): one writer.

AN ANSWER IS TYPED BY ITS PLAN (docs/DATACUBE_ONE_APP_DESIGN_2026_10_11.md §15.3a), as the tab's executor types its
own (engine-client's ``typedByPlan``): each column carries the compiler's type (its field's ``legend.type``), a column
the plan does not type is refused, and each value is exact, as the database stored it -- an Integer an int64 (a sum
DuckDB answers as an exact decimal included), keeping that exact decimal only past 64 bits, never wrong; a Decimal
exact; a DateTime as stored, in UTC (the session's zone), to the microsecond; a Variant as the planner's SQL answers it
-- its JSON text, or, a STRUCT or a LIST under ``SELECT *``, as stored, until the planner answers every Variant as JSON
(§15.3a: the Compiler Rewrite line's egress fix). ``to_pandas`` keeps them so: an Integer or a Boolean with nulls stays an integer or a boolean (pandas'
nullable types), never a float or an object.
