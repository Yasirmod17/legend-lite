"""Dataframes as Legend tables: a frame registered in duckdb-python, its model written by the compiler, and
queries the compiler plans run by DuckDB, answered as Arrow.

    frames = Frames()
    trades = frames.register('trades', df)              # Live: every query reads df as it is then
    trades.execute("->filter(x|$x.desk == 'FX')")       # a pyarrow.Table

A frame is anything Arrow reads: a pandas or polars DataFrame, a pyarrow Table, any object that exports
Arrow -- or a function returning one, so a Live table follows a frame you rebuild. It is handed to DuckDB
AS ARROW: duckdb-python's own pandas reader is about ten times slower on text columns, and reading a
pandas frame through it once does not see later changes (pandas copies on write).

LIVE (the default) re-reads the frame at every query, so the answer is the frame's as it is then; if its
columns changed, the model is written again. SNAPPED copies it into DuckDB once: faster to query, and it
never changes. Either way the frame is an ordinary DuckDB table or view named as registered, so the
compiler reads its catalog and writes its model exactly as it does for a DataCube table
(``table_model``): one writer.
