// THE PAGE'S SOURCES (docs/DATACUBE_ONE_APP_DESIGN_2026_10_11.md §3.1, §4.4; step 1b): where a grid's rows come from,
// and opening each kind -- a file from the computer or an example, read into the host's database under a table of its
// own; a warehouse table, Live there as the person and Snapped into the host's database; a remote Parquet, CSV or
// Iceberg file, mounted as a view; a saved query, over its project's model and rows -- for a new grid, or to rebuild a
// saved one over what its source holds now. Every one is opened through the host's services (src/app/services.ts),
// so the app opens sources the same way on every host; the source picker (src/ui/source-picker.ts) is offered the
// sections the services can open.
//
// Each grid has ITS OWN planner over ITS OWN model (`another`): a page's grids share no model. The tables a page's
// files are read into are its own and named apart (no grid's table is ever replaced by another's), and a file's table
// goes with its last grid.
