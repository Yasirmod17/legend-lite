// PYTHON'S SERVICES (docs/DATACUBE_ONE_APP_DESIGN_2026_10_11.md §3.2, §4.3, §5; step 2a): what DataCube's app runs on
// when Python shows it -- in a tab of its own (demo/engine.ts, over HTTP to Python's engine with its token) or under a
// notebook's cell (demo/widget.ts, over the widget's channel, which the notebook authenticates). The app is the tab's;
// only these services differ.
//
// - THE ROWS ARE PYTHON'S (R4): the page sends Pure, never SQL. Python plans it with its planner and runs the SQL on its
//   DuckDB, and the rows come back in upstream's Arrow format, declared (RemoteRun over the engine's pure/v1 execute).
//   A grid's columns, a query's print, are Python's compiler's answers the same way.
// - THE DATA IN is Python's frames: each a model Python wrote when the frame was registered (`cube.json?table=`).
// - PYTHON IS ANOTHER EDITOR of what the page shows (§5): it changes the page (`ll.Page`) and its frames, the page
//   follows their versions (`version.json`, or the widget's), and it says what it is now, for `page.read()`
//   (`page.json`, with the version it opened: what it says of a page Python has replaced is refused).
//
// - A PAGE'S FILE (an upload, an example) goes into Python's DuckDB (step 2b): its bytes to Python (`file.json`), read
//   there by DataCube's own code (upload.ts, run headless), which writes its model; the grid's rows are then Python's
//   over that model, as a frame's are. Offered where Python says it takes files (`services.json`: the datacube extra).
//
// What Python does not answer yet is a service it does not give, and the app does not offer what reads it (§3.4): its
// page store (Save, Open…: step 2d), a remote file (2b's second part), the other planes (2c), its model home and saved
// queries (step 3). A share link needs an address others can open; Python's is this machine's loopback.
