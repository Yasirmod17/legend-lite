// THE STORE IN THIS PAGE: upstream's `/api/pure/v1/query` answered without a server, by legend-lite's own rules
// (core's `com.legend.queries.SavedQueries`, the ones its server and Python's native library answer with) compiled to
// WebAssembly (//query-store:page), over the page's own records (records.ts: IndexedDB, so every app on this origin
// shares them) -- one implementation, only the storage the page's (docs/ONE_PLATFORM_PROGRAM_2026_10_12.md B5). Each
// call hands the module every record and writes back every query it wrote; the module keeps nothing between calls, so
// two tabs over the one IndexedDB see each other's queries at their next call; each call is one transaction of the
// records, so no tab writes between another's read and its writes. It is handed to the one client
// (client.ts) in place of the network, and the one wire-level suite (test/conformance.ts) runs against it and against
// legend-lite's server alike.
//
// What it cannot be is a server: its queries live in this browser only, and its user is the name the page was
// configured with, not someone signed in.
