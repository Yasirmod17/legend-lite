 * CHANNEL B ON EVERY LANE (2026-10-11, the user's ask): the same runner on the database channel A's lane runs on
 * ({@code LEGENDLITE_PCT_BACKEND}, {@link PctBackend}), diffed against THAT lane's channel A ledger
 * ({@code Test_LegendLite_<Lane>_<Suite>Functions_PCT}) and, where legend-engine publishes one, its PCT manifest for
 * the same database (Postgres, H2, Snowflake, Databricks; none for SQLite, MariaDB, MySQL or BigQuery, so there every
 * wire bug is a true one). DuckDB, the reference lane, keeps its own pins in each suite's test; every other lane is
 * judged here, by its own measured numbers.
 *
 * <p>The numbers: PASS may only grow and the two disagreement counts may only shrink, as DuckDB's. A WIRE-BUG is a
 * test channel B fails where channel A passes on the same database; B-FIXES-A, the converse, is measured and printed,
 * not pinned (channel B passing more is not a regression). The never-happens invariants hold on every lane: no label
 * lie escapes reconciliation, and the database's verdict and the host referee never disagree.
