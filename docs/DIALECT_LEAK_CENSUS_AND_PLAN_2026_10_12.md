# The dialect-leak census and the plan to close it (2026-10-12)

**Status: PLAN, for review. Nothing below has been implemented.**

**The ask (the user, 2026-10-12):** *everything SQL-related hidden in the SQL dialect; anything connection- or
workspace-related behind its own interface; SqlTypeCensus probably behind the dialect too; first a comprehensive
census of every leak, not a sample; then a plan we review together; raw SQL included.*

## 1. How the census was taken

**Two scanner passes over every tracked source file** (`.java .ts .tsx .js .mjs .py .kt`). Each file was lexed into
code, comments and string literals; comments were skipped.

- **Code patterns:**
  - dialect class names and references;
  - `DatabaseType.X`;
  - driver packages and objects;
  - JDBC calls such as `getDatabaseProductName` and `unwrap`;
  - `java.sql.Types` uses;
  - raw-SQL rewriting entry points;
  - session-setup entry points;
  - product names (DuckDB, Postgres, H2, Snowflake, ... MongoDB, Elastic).
- **String patterns:**
  - SQL statement heads and bodies;
  - SQL fragments (`COALESCE`, `ATTACH`, `information_schema`, `pg_*`, `duckdb_*`, ...);
  - product names;
  - `jdbc:` URLs;
  - type spellings;
  - vendor error text and SQLStates.

**The scanners found 27,956 candidate sites in 1,007 files.** Every one was then classified by a reviewer who read the
code, in 9 slices: core execution, core front end, the other product modules, the spec/pct/testing harness, core
tests (two slices), other modules' tests, tooling, and the dialect package plus the IR. Each slice's output was checked
to hold exactly one row per site, with the same id set. Each slice also reported **misses**: leaks the patterns could
not see. Those are in §7.

The scanner and the per-site classifications are kept with the session's working files. Phase 0 below turns the
census into a permanent guard.

**The classes:**

| class | sites | groups | meaning |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **LEAK-SQL** | 176 | 13 | SQL text composed outside the dialect |
| **LEAK-ID** | 91 | 10 | a branch on *which* database, outside the registries |
| **LEAK-TYPE** | 110 | 5 | a per-database type-name table outside the dialect |
| **LEAK-RAW** | 20 | 4 | raw SQL rewritten or lexed outside the dialect |
| **LEAK-CONN** | 41 | 6 | per-database connection handling outside a connector |
| **LEAK-ERR** | 3 | 1 | vendor error text matched outside the dialect or connector |
| **DIALECT-SHARED** | 247 | 53 | inside `sql/dialect/`, but a database's fact sits in a *shared* file, not its own class |
| **TEST-LEAK** | 1,002 | 45 | test code branching on the backend, or opening backend-specific sessions inline (36 groups live, 9 in dead code) |
| SEAM | 709 | 51 | the designated registries (`Databases`, `Sessions`, `PctBackend.Lane`, `EngineText`, guard registers) |
| DIALECT-INTERNAL | 3,585 | 64 | a dialect writing its own database's SQL: correct |
| LANG | 5,693 | 147 | the Legend language: store-DSL types, connection grammar, protocol names, `DynaFn`'s support table |
| SINGLE-BACKEND-APP | 3,759 | 69 | modules whose engine is DuckDB by design (datacube, engine-client, python, warehouse's own engine) |
| TEST-GOLDEN | 9,694 | 329 | tests asserting one dialect's SQL, or fixtures for the database under test |
| DIAG / FP | 2,826 | 204 | messages naming a product / false positives |

`DynaFn`'s per-database `Dialect` enum (1,298 sites) is LANG: it mirrors legend-engine's support table. Its only reader
is one error message (`RelOpTranslator.java:719`).

## 2. The verdict

**The claim "each database's differences live in one place, its dialect" is not true today.** The worst of it is
structural, not scattered:

1. **Inside the dialect package, a database's facts are spread over 4 to 9 files.** Its function names, type names,
   keywords and collection capabilities are rows in the shared `Spellings`, `TypeNames`, `Lexicon` and
   `CarrierStrategies.Caps`. Seven of the `Spellings` rows are *derived from DuckDB's row*: changing a DuckDB name
   silently changes seven other databases.
2. **The base renderer (`AnsiSqlRenderer`) is DuckDB and H2 in disguise.** About 25 arms spell DuckDB:
   `list(.. ORDER BY)`, `EXCLUDE`, `rowid`, `json_object`, `uuid()`, `time_bucket`, `epoch_ms`, `//`, `T[]`, `MAP`,
   `STRUCT` and strftime codes. Its carrier capabilities default to H2's, and its DDL types to H2's.
   - Every dialect that does not override an arm inherits DuckDB's spelling *silently*.
   - H2, H2Modern and EngineStyleH2 pass every function they do not handle up to those arms, so H2 receives DuckDB text
     where it should get a clear refusal.
3. **The IR carries DuckDB and SQL spellings** (AGENTS invariant 3a forbids this):
   - `SqlSource.Join.Kind` holds `"LEFT OUTER JOIN"` as a field.
   - Date arithmetic puts the string `"to_days"` (a DuckDB function name) into the IR.
   - Lowering compares `JSON_TYPE(..)` and `TYPEOF(..)` to DuckDB's type-name strings.
   - `RawSql`'s splitter and classifier lex SQL text inside the IR package.
4. **Raw SQL is rewritten in a shared file that switches on the target.** `RawSqlBoundary.Target { DUCKDB, POSTGRES }`
   (I added the Postgres arm last session, extending the pattern instead of fixing it). It sits beside two
   identity-in-disguise flags, `rawTarget()` and `rawH2IsNative()`.
5. **SQL is composed outside the dialect in product code:**
   - `TestDataGenerator`: about 400 lines of hand SQL.
   - `CatalogGrids`: `information_schema` SQL composed *in the type checker*.
   - `StatementExecutor`: a raw `CREATE SCHEMA`.
   - The engine-text `INSERT` and temp-table text.
   - A MariaDB session-variable query in `Sessions`.
6. **Reading results back holds per-database knowledge outside the dialect.** `SqlTypeCensus` and
   `Executor.pureOfSqlType` contain driver type-name tables, and `SqlTypeCensus` branches on dialect *class names*.
7. **There is no connector interface.** Connection knowledge is spread across five per-concern switches in `Sessions`,
   plus `StorelessRuntime`, `ConnectionResolver`, `CreateClass` and an H2 URL spelled in four places.
8. **The test harnesses have no backend interface:**
   - The corpus picks its backend with string switches and if-chains (`DuckWorkspaces` and `ServerWorkspaces` are
     called directly).
   - About 4,000 behavioural tests open `jdbc:duckdb:` inline (about 330 sites).
   - 26 resolver tests each copy a `sqlOf()` pinned to `new DuckDb()`.
9. **The guards that should catch all of this are blind to most databases:**
   - `DialectBoundaryTest` counts 7 of the 11 dialect constructions and 3 of the 24 database types.
   - Its driver census and `ArchitectureTest`'s driver rules miss the Postgres, SQLite, MariaDB, ClickHouse, Trino and
     cloud drivers.

**What is right today, and is the pattern to copy:**

- No dialect tests another dialect's identity.
- `CatalogRules` is a shared record type whose rows each dialect owns.
- `PctBackend.Lane` is already one per-database abstraction for PCT.
- `Databases` and `Sessions` are exhaustive switches with no `default`.
- `DuckDbAppenderLoad` and `DuckDbCells` are per-database objects behind interfaces (`BulkLoad`, `DriverCells`).

## 3. Real defects found on the way (not only structure)

| # | defect | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | H2 (and H2Modern, EngineStyleH2) get DuckDB spellings for functions they do not override, instead of an honest refusal | `H2.java:404` → `super.call`; base arms at `AnsiSqlRenderer.java:637-892, 1095-1270` |
| 2 | Postgres `int8`, ClickHouse `Nullable(Int64)` and BigQuery `INT64` are absent from the driver-type table that types dynamic-pivot and grid columns | `Executor.java:1062-1085` (read; a test will confirm the failure) |
| 3 | Every raw SQL on DuckDB is rewritten *as if it were H2 text*, including a user's native `executeInDb` SQL (an unaliased `count(*)` gets relabelled) | `DuckDb.java:273` → `RawSqlAdapt`; `RawSql` records no origin |
| 4 | `CorpusDifferentialTest` renders every service with the DuckDB dialect, even services whose runtime declares H2, Postgres, Snowflake or Databricks | `CorpusDifferentialTest.java:46, 63, 81-83` |
| 5 | On the Postgres corpus lane, on-demand fixtures run *without isolation*: `isolateBegin` returns null and the caller proceeds | `DuckWorkspaces.java:198-202`, `MinimalCorpus.java:692-696` |
| 6 | `AbstractDatabaseTest`'s SQLite subclass declares `type: SQLite; specification: DuckDB {}` | `AbstractDatabaseTest.java:285-296` |
| 7 | The warehouse wraps `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` in `postgres_query` on an attached Postgres catalog (expected to fail; read, not run) | `warehouse/.../WhConnection.java:66-93` |
| 8 | The warehouse reports engine "DuckDB" for an attached Postgres catalog | `warehouse/.../server/Sessions.java:46` |

## 4. The target: what adding a 12th database touches

The acceptance test for the whole program: **a new database is three classes and one line in each of three
registries.** Nothing else in the codebase may need an edit.

| layer | the one class per database | what it owns | registry (one exhaustive switch) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SQL** (plan side, no JDBC) | `sql/dialect/<Db>.java` | All SQL text (queries, DDL, DML, session setup); its function names, type names, keywords and carrier capabilities, as constants in the class; reading raw engine-H2 text (`fromEngineH2`); catalog queries; identifier folding; reading the driver's type names back (`wireTypeName`) and its values (`normalize`, which exists) | `Databases.dialect(type)` |
| **Connection** (execution side) | `exec/connect/<Db>Connector.java` *(new)* | JDBC product name, URL from a connection spec, driver, in-process private instance, bulk loader, driver cells, held raise (MariaDB/MySQL), in-memory connection declaration | `Connectors.of(type)` *(new; replaces `Sessions`' five switches)* |
| **Test backend** (harness) | `testing/.../<Db>Backend.java` *(new; absorbs `PctBackend.Lane`'s arms)* | Starting the server (embedded or cloud), a fresh **workspace** (DuckDB `ATTACH`, Postgres `CREATE DATABASE`, H2 a fresh in-memory database, clouds a schema per package), fixture isolation, the referee's reader, the Pure connection block, seeding via the dialect, roster and pin names, census ceilings | `TestBackends.of(type)` |

The `DatabaseType` enum and the connection grammar are the Legend language (LANG). They stay where they are.

Phase 0 enforces this mechanically: database identity (product names, `DatabaseType.X` constants, dialect class names,
driver packages) may appear only in those files, the grammar and the guard registers.

## 5. The plan

Every phase lands green on its own:

- `//gates:local`;
- both channels of the local PCT lanes (DuckDB, H2, Postgres, SQLite, MariaDB, MySQL, Trino, ClickHouse), with no pin
  growing;
- the DuckDB and H2 corpus rosters unchanged;
- the leak ratchet (Phase 0) only shrinking.

**Pure moves must produce zero rendered-SQL diffs.** An unchanged golden is the proof that nothing moved but code.

The cloud lanes (Snowflake, Databricks and BigQuery) run once after Phase 2 and once at the end.

### Phase 0: the guards see everything (first; no behaviour change)

- **`DialectBoundaryTest`:**
  - count all 11 dialect constructions (its pin under-counts at 7);
  - census all 24 `DatabaseType` constants and every driver package;
  - walk `core/src/main/duckdb`.
- **Driver-package rules** in `ArchitectureTest`, `JdbcSurfaceCensusTest` and `TenetRatchetTest`: add `org.postgresql`,
  `org.sqlite`, `org.mariadb`, `com.clickhouse`, `io.trino`, `net.snowflake`, `com.databricks`/`com.simba` and BigQuery.
- **`SqlTextRatchetTest`**: add `create schema` (its blind spot let `StatementExecutor.java:2951` through).
- **New `DialectLeakRatchetTest`**: the census's mechanical part as a shrink-only, per-file ratchet, outside an
  allowlist of owners. It covers product names in code, `DatabaseType.X`, dialect class names, driver imports, inline
  `jdbc:` URLs and `getDatabaseProductName`. At the end of the program every pin outside the owners is zero, and the
  ratchet becomes a ban.
- Each pin corrected here carries a dated justification ("the guard was blind; the census of 2026-10-12").

Size: about 300 lines of tests.

### Phase 1: one place per database inside the dialect package (pure moves)

- **1a. Rows into classes.** The `Spellings`, `TypeNames`, `Lexicon` and `Caps` rows become constants in their own
  dialect classes, following the `CatalogRules` pattern. The record types stay shared.
  - The seven rows derived from `DUCKDB.fnNames()` are written out as explicit lists. A one-off check at the move
    asserts each expanded set equals the derived one.
  - `MySql` keeps inheriting MariaDB's rows, as the family member it is.
  - About 750 lines move; none are added.
- **1b. A neutral base renderer.**
  - The ~25 DuckDB arms move into `DuckDb`.
  - `Caps.H2` and the H2 DDL types move into `H2`.
  - DIVIDE's literal `DOUBLE` becomes `castTypeName(DOUBLE)`.
  - Base arms throw `DialectCapability`, as `listCall` already does.
  - Every other dialect that inherits an arm today gets it explicitly or refuses it; see **decision D1**. First, an
    inventory of arm × dialect, read from the code and the PCT pins.
- **1c. Raw SQL into each dialect.** One hook, `SqlDialect.fromEngineH2(String) → List<String>`, replaces
  `RawSqlBoundary.Target`, `rawTarget()`, `rawH2IsNative()` and the shared `RawSqlAdapt` pass:
  - H2 returns the text unchanged;
  - DuckDB does today's rewrite;
  - Postgres does today's rewrite plus its types and lower-case folding;
  - the other eight refuse by name.

  A neutral H2-statement lexer stays shared. `RawSqlLedgerTest` and `DialectBoundaryTest.RAW_H2_CALLERS` are re-pinned
  with a dated note. See **decision D2** on where raw text comes from.
- **1d. Odds and ends.**
  - `CatalogModel`'s `* REPLACE` moves to `DuckDb`.
  - `DdlSpelling.h2ExecIdentifier` moves to `H2`, and `setup/Ddl` asks the dialect instead of assuming H2's rule for
    every target.
  - The stale docs are fixed: AGENTS.md and `Lexicon` still say "SQLite is not a class"; there is also an orphaned
    `SqlDialect` javadoc and a wrong `RawSql` package note.

Size: about 1,500 lines touched, most of them moved.

### Phase 2: the IR says *what*, never *how* (invariant 3a)

- `Join.Kind.sql` becomes `joinKeyword(Kind)` on the renderer.
- Date arithmetic's `"to_days"` string becomes a typed unit operand (`DateShifts.java:67-73`, `Scalars.java:722, 3045`).
- The `JSON_TYPE(..) = 'OBJECT'` and `TYPEOF(..) = 'DATE'` compares become typed predicates (`JsonKindIs`, `TypeIs`).
  Each dialect renders them; today MariaDB refuses TYPEOF because "its names are DuckDB's". Sites:
  `CanonicalRenderSql.java:934-998`, `Scalars.java:2656`, `CollectionLanes.java:354`, `LiteralSpelling.java:232`,
  `Fold.java:1300`.
- `SqlAgg.Fn` names that double as DuckDB spellings (`AnsiSqlRenderer.java:1084-1086`) go through each dialect's
  spelling row.
- DuckDB strftime codes carried as strings become typed format tokens. **Decision D3.**
- `RawSql`'s splitter and classifier move out of the IR package into the dialect (`splitScript`, `isRowQuery`); the
  type checker's `executeInDb` sniff asks the dialect.

Size: about 400 lines. Goldens unchanged.

### Phase 3: SQL composed outside the dialect (product)

- **`StatementExecutor.dropAndCreateSchemaInDb`**: render the existing `SqlDdl.CreateSchema` through the session's
  dialect.
- **`setup/Ddl.insertText`**: the engine-text dialect renders `SqlDml`.
- **`CatalogGrids`**: the catalog SQL leaves the type checker. A typed catalog-grid node gets rendered by
  `SqlDialect.catalogGrid(kind, patterns)`. Its `data_type`→JDBC-code table becomes a dialect method.
- **`TestDataGenerator`, the largest item (about 450 lines):**
  - the live fetch, CSV envelope, compare temp tables and `EXCEPT` diff become IR rendered by the session's dialect;
  - the engine-H2 plan text is rendered by `EngineStyleH2` from IR;
  - the `duckType` table becomes the store's declared type plus the dialect's DDL spelling;
  - the hand-built `DATE '...'` literals, identifier folding and `"default"` schema go through the dialect.
- **`InProtocol` and `PlanText`** stop slicing and spelling engine text by hand; they render from IR.
- **One `EngineText` constant** for the engine's test database replaces the `"H2"` literals in `ContextReading`
  (a *default* that picks the dialect), `StatementExecutor:772`, `PlanText:35, 446` and `TestDataGenerator:1430, 1491`.
- An `EngineTextDialect` interface replaces `EngineStyleH2` as a parameter type (`StatementExecutor`, `PlanEnvelope`).
- **wasm `Boundary`**: `testDataSql` picks its dialect through `Databases`; `DuckDb.CATALOG_COLUMNS_SQL` becomes
  `SqlDialect.catalogColumnsQuery`.

Size: about 900 lines.

### Phase 4: reading results back is the dialect's

**What `SqlTypeCensus` is** (you asked): a *measurement*, not a feature. On every executed statement it compares the
type the compiler stamped on each output column with the type the database actually returned. It counts agreements,
named subtypings and outright mismatches: "label lies", pinned to zero on every PCT lane. To compare, it must translate
each driver's type names (Postgres `int8`, ClickHouse `Nullable(Int64)`, BigQuery `INT64`) into one vocabulary. That
translation table is per-database knowledge, and it lives in `exec/`, branching on dialect *class names*. It belongs on
the dialect.

- **`SqlTypeCensus`**: each dialect supplies `wireTypeName(String driverTypeName)`. The census asks the dialect and
  never names one. Its counts must not move; the PCT census gates pin them.
- **`Executor.pureOfSqlType`, `GridProbe` and `PctProbe`**: type by `java.sql.Types` code where that is unambiguous, and
  by the dialect's `wireTypeName` where it is not. This fixes defect 2, with a test per database.
- **`DynamicPivot`'s `BigInteger`/`BigDecimal` cases** (the ClickHouse one is mine, from 32e1e0b) and **`Executor`'s
  H2 `byte[]` JSON decoding** move into each dialect's `normalize`.

Size: about 400 lines.

### Phase 5: the connector interface (execution side)

- **`DatabaseConnector`, one class per database:**
  - `jdbcProduct()`;
  - `opening(spec, auth)`, the URL;
  - `inProcess()` / `openPrivate()`;
  - `bulkLoad()`, which absorbs `DuckDbAppenderLoad`;
  - `cells()`, which absorbs `DuckDbCells`;
  - `heldRaise(Connection)` for MariaDB and MySQL; the SQL text comes from the dialect;
  - `inMemoryDeclaration()`, used by `StorelessRuntime` and `CreateClass`.
  - H2's private URL and its `H2Settings` suffix are spelled once, in H2's connector.
- **`Sessions`' five per-concern switches collapse into `Connectors.of(type)`.**
  - `ConnectionResolver`'s `Opening` switch is a capability in disguise (`Named` means H2, `Held` means DuckDB or
    SQLite); it moves onto the connector.
  - Driver imports become legal only in connector classes, enforced by Phase 0's rule.
- **`Databases` shrinks to type → dialect.** Its facts become dialect methods:
  - `servers`, H2's version pin;
  - `loadsRowsInBulk`;
  - `inListTempTables`, which is engine text and goes to the engine-text dialect.

Size: about 600 lines. No behaviour change.

### Phase 6: test backends (the harnesses)

- **`TestBackend` per database**, built on its connector, with these methods:
  - `open()` and `openUtc()`;
  - `openWorkspace()`;
  - `isolateFixture()`;
  - `readerOn(workspace)` and `referee()`;
  - `connectionBlock()`;
  - `seed(TableDefinition)` via the dialect;
  - `name()`;
  - `censusCeilings(suite)`.

  `PctBackend.Lane`'s per-database arms move here. The five embedded-server launchers share an `EmbeddedServer`
  interface.
- **Corpus:**
  - The `BACKEND` switch and its `default -> DuckDB` arm, the `openSession` chain and the ~20 `H2_BACKEND ? h2 : duckdb`
    roster ternaries all become `TestBackend` calls.
  - `DuckWorkspaces` and `ServerWorkspaces` become `DuckDbBackend.openWorkspace()` and
    `PostgresBackend.openWorkspace()`.
  - The H2 fixture-aside SQL becomes `isolateFixture()`. A backend that cannot isolate refuses, which fixes defect 5.
  - The referee's routing by product name and its `DuckDBConnection.duplicate()` become `readerOn` and `referee()`.
  - The hidden warehouse lane, behind a second system property, becomes a backend of its own.
  - `CorpusOne` and the dead `Corpus.DIALECT` go.
  - `H2Verify`'s microsecond floor becomes a per-backend precision fact.
- **PCT:**
  - `PctCensusGate`'s environment-variable branches become per-lane ceilings that fail when a lane has none.
  - The channel B suites' `isReference()` branches become `PINS`.
- **Core tests:**
  - `AbstractDatabaseTest` (27 subclasses) takes a `backend()`. This fixes defect 6.
  - About 330 inline `jdbc:duckdb:` and `jdbc:h2:mem:` opens become `TestBackends.of(t).open()`. The change is
    mechanical.
  - The 26 resolver `sqlOf()` copies become one shared harness.
  - `StressSuites`, `StressTool` and `StressServiceSuites` take a `DatabaseType`.
  - `CorpusDifferentialTest` renders with the runtime's own dialect. This fixes defect 4 and may surface real
    differences.
  - Eight single-file leaks: `PlanMakerTest`, `PlanRunnerTest`, `StoreTypesTest`, `MissingValueInComputedColumnTest`,
    `QuotedColumnNameTest`, `PostgresArmTest`, `RowLoadTest` and `LadderRender`.
- **`Databases.implemented()`**: tests and tools iterate it instead of hand-listing databases. That covers
  `SqlWriterTest`, `SeedSpellingTest`, `StoreTypesTest`, `PlanMakerTest`, `PlanRunnerTest` and `RenderCensus`, which
  misses 4 dialects today.
- **`scripts/corpus/differential.py`** emits neutral rows, and the test renders the seed through the dialect.

Size: about 2,500 lines, most of them the mechanical replacement of inline opens across about 130 test files.

**Phase 6 is also exactly what the cloud corpus runs need:** a workspace per package on Snowflake, Databricks and
BigQuery is just three more `openWorkspace()` implementations. So this program unblocks the corpus-on-every-database
work (tasks #29 and #30), rather than only delaying it.

### Phase 7: the other modules

- **Warehouse** (decision D4). It is *mixed-engine*: DuckDB plus Postgres catalogs attached through DuckDB's postgres
  extension. It is also barred from depending on core (`//tools/deps:warehouse_closure_test`). Its Postgres knowledge
  (SQL, libpq DSN, URL, error text, password prompt, engine name) is gathered into one warehouse-owned class behind its
  existing `Attachment` registry. Defects 7 and 8 get tests.
- **datacube and engine-client** (decision D5). Fix the paths that can reach a non-DuckDB engine:
  - the `snap.ts:205` preflight count, which runs on a warehouse catalog that may be Postgres, is planned like any
    query;
  - the query demo's seed.

  The five TypeScript copies of identifier quoting become one helper. SQL that only ever runs on the tab's own DuckDB
  stays: it is that engine's setup, like a connector's.
- **Dead code** (decision D6): `experiments/` (it is in `.bazelignore`), `docs/parked/InDbVerdict.java`,
  `tools/spikes` and the probe harnesses under `docs/` hold 255 of the 1,002 TEST-LEAK sites, and no target builds
  them.

### Order and size

| order | phase | rough lines | behaviour change |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | P0 guards | 300 | none |
| 2 | P1 dialect package | 1,500 | none, except D1 refusals where a DuckDB spelling was wrong |
| 3 | P2 IR | 400 | none |
| 4 | P3 SQL outside the dialect | 900 | none intended; `TestDataGenerator` re-measured |
| 5 | P4 reading back | 400 | fixes defect 2 |
| 6 | P5 connectors | 600 | none |
| 7 | P6 test backends | 2,500 | fixes defects 4–6 |
| 8 | P7 other modules | 400 + deletions | fixes defects 7–8 |

## 6. Decisions for review

| # | question | recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | A dialect that silently inherits a DuckDB arm from the base renderer today: copy the arm into it, or make it refuse? | Copy it where that dialect's PCT lanes prove the spelling works there. Refuse with a named `DialectCapability` everywhere else (H2's GUID, TIME_BUCKET and MAP_EMPTY, for example). Behaviour changes only for statements that already produce wrong text. |
| **D2** | Raw SQL comes from two places: legend-engine-style **H2 text** (corpus test data, `testDataSetupSqls`) and a user's **native** SQL (`executeInDb`). Today both are rewritten as H2 text. | Record the origin on `RawSql`. Run `fromEngineH2` only on engine-H2 text; pass native SQL through untouched. Measure the corpus before and after. |
| **D3** | The IR's *meanings* are DuckDB's in places: its typing rules, LIST_SLICE's end, H2's scan order, strftime codes. Is that a leak? | Keep the meanings as the platform's written contract; every dialect already emulates them. Replace only the DuckDB *strings* inside the IR (`"to_days"`, strftime codes, json_type and typeof names) with typed values. |
| **D4** | Warehouse: share core's dialect, or keep its own per-engine classes? | Keep the closure rule and gather its Postgres knowledge into one owner behind `Attachment`. Revisit if it gains a third engine. |
| **D5** | TypeScript apps: must every SQL go through the planner? | No for tab-only DuckDB setup. Yes for anything that can reach a server engine. |
| **D6** | Delete the dead trees? | Yes. The evidence they produced (results files, notes) stays in `docs/`. |
| **D7** | Land phase by phase on the branch, each green, then pause for review after P1 (the most visible restructuring)? | Yes. |
| **D8** | Which case does a store's bare name have on Postgres? The engine emits it unquoted, so Postgres folds it to lower case; the corpus's setup text assumes that. Main's `#SQL{...}#` Postgres fixture and DataCube's `infer.test.ts` assume the opposite: the name is kept as declared and quoted. Folding was tried and reverted on 2026-10-12 (neema2/legend-lite#30's CI). | Decide it once, as the dialect's own rule (P1). The two kinds of test then follow whichever rule is chosen. Folding matches the engine and the corpus; keeping case matches `#SQL{...}#`. |

## 7. The misses (leaks the patterns could not see; each slice's reviewers found them by reading)

- **Base-renderer arms with DuckDB spellings** that no pattern flagged: `AnsiSqlRenderer.java:637, 642, 668, 674, 686,
  740, 760, 830, 832, 850, 874, 889, 892, 1095-1100, 1229-1239, 1247-1270`.
- **The IR vocabulary is DuckDB's:**
  - STRFTIME codes (`Trino.java:942`);
  - TYPEOF names (`MariaDb.java:2313`);
  - LIST_SLICE semantics (`Snowflake.java:777`);
  - the typing rules (`SqlTyping.java`, "DuckDB 1.5.0");
  - the scan order (`ScanOrder.java:18-64`, H2's).
- **DuckDB type-name compares in lowering**: `Scalars.java:2656`, `CollectionLanes.java:354`,
  `LiteralSpelling.java:232`, `Fold.java:1300`.
- **Values bypassing `normalize`**: `DynamicPivot.java:91-94` and `Executor.java:760-768` (H2's `byte[]` JSON).
- **`H2Settings` URL suffix** spliced into hand-built `jdbc:h2:mem:` URLs in pct, spec and core tests.
- **Connections:**
  - `ConnectionResolver.java:189-198`: the `Opening` switch, and H2's in-memory name minted in the server.
  - `ServiceTestRunner.java:154-160, 419` and `CsvSeed.java:233-243`: test data rides only in a `LocalH2` connection
    spec, whatever the database.
- **Text tests in disguise:**
  - `InProtocol.java:127-131`: `startsWith("TestDatabaseConnection")`.
  - `StoreCompiler.java:104-111`: string type kinds in `SqlDdl.ColumnType`, which BigQuery and MariaDB test with
    `contains("BINARY")`.
- **Corpus harness:**
  - `OTHER_LANE` means "neither DuckDB nor H2" and skips every census for Postgres.
  - The warehouse lane hides behind a second system property.
- **PCT:** `maxIntNullEmpty` falls back to DuckDB's values for any other lane.
- **Tests:**
  - `PlanRunnerTest.java:199-209, 321` copies H2's server versions and its type table.
  - `ConnectionLeaseTest.java:240` detects leaks through DuckDB's `.wal` file.
  - Two resolver tests append DuckDB's `ORDER BY ALL`.
- **Bazel and corpus scripts:**
  - The Bazel lane lists repeat the Java ones (`spec/BUILD.bazel:17`, `spec/corpus.bzl`, `core/BUILD.bazel:758`).
  - The driver-jar list lives in BUILD files.
  - `scripts/corpus/combos.py:104-109` leaves REAL out of the shared corpus because of one DuckDB connector defect.
- **Warehouse:**
  - libpq's "no password supplied" text is matched (`Catalogs.java:98, 105`).
  - A TimeZone regex is run over libpq options (`Postgres.java:142`).
- **Other modules:**
  - `datacube/test/infer.test.ts` pins Postgres catalog type names and the Postgres typed constant inside regex
    literals. It must move with those facts.
  - `WarehouseJdbcTest.java:291-306` copies the corpus's DuckDB workspace steps.

## Appendix A: every leak group (137), by class
